If bold colours or dramatic visual statements aren’y quite your cup of tea you should throw some attention in the direction of Aurora Nuevo.

This theme is described as a “pastel colored Material design like Gnome theme” and, at first blush, that’s exactly what it is. But Aurora Nuevo is available in a wide array of different accent colours (blue pictured above) as well as a less flat variant too for those who want it.

If you like the look of Dark Aurora but a pinch of colour with your eye candy, the sultry tones of Aurora Nuevo should suit you well (especially when paired with matching folders icons).
